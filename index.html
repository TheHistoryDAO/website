          <h4>How does History DAO raise funds?</h4>
          <p>
            We will fundraise through a public, transparent smart contract. This means that the terms of the fundraising
            campaign will be written into a smart contract on the blockchain, and anyone can view and verify the details
            of the campaign. The funds raised will be held in the smart contract until the campaign is completed, and
            the distribution of funds will be automatically executed based on the rules and conditions set forth in the
            contract. This transparent, decentralized approach will ensure that the fundraising process is fair and
            transparent, and will enable anyone to participate and support our cause.
